# Asus PCE-N53 linux driver for kernel 3.x, 4.x and 5.x

## First a little bit of a story on Asus PCE N53 Wi-Fi network card...

When I bought Asus PCE N53 Wi-Fi network card it wasn't working in Ubuntu 14.10 with kernel 3.16. Then I found a [patched driver](https://github.com/unused/patched-Asus-PCE-N53-linux-driver) here on GitHub that had been tested with Fedora but I wasn't able to compile it on Ubuntu so I decided to create this repository and provide working sources and instructions for Ubuntu users. The instructions were compiled from [this superuser thread](http://superuser.com/questions/663190/asus-pce-n53-11n-n600-pci-e-adapter-on-3-x-kernel). You'll need a working ethernet connection to install the build dependencies.

## How to Install

Simply clone this repository, install build dependencies, compile sources, install compiled module and use modprobe to activate it.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/mareksuscak/asus-pce-n53-linux.git
$ cd asus-pce-n53-linux
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo modprobe rt5592sta
```

If everything worked well you should be able to connect to the Wireless network now.

## Troubleshooting

### Seeing Compile Errors?

Some users have had success compiling this driver after [making minor changes](https://github.com/mareksuscak/asus-pce-n53-linux/issues/4#issue-215234424) to the source code which normally result in a compile error.
